"""
Memory-aware LRU Cache function decorator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A modification of the builtin ``functools.lru_cache`` decorator that takes an
additional keyword argument, ``use_memory_up_to``. The cache is considered full
if there are fewer than ``use_memory_up_to`` bytes of memory available.

If ``use_memory_up_to`` is set, then ``maxsize`` has no effect.

Uses the ``psutil`` module to get the available memory.
